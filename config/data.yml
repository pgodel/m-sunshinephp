         AngularJS is a javascript framework that can help you build applications faster and with less javascript code. However, to use Angular requires a new way of approaching javascript development. Instead of manually binding callbacks to browser events, angular has the concept of applying changes to individual scopes on digest cycles compiled right from the html. What is the benefit of this approach? Have you ever written event callback methods bound to a specific html markup hierarchy only to have the markup change slightly and break your logic? Angular provides an escape from this by using the html markup as a means of binding your logic to the page. When the markup changes, so does your bindings. We will be creating a basic shop application to learn the core concepts of AngularJS: scopes, controllers, services, filters, and directives. Once you get the basics of how Angular works, we will cover more advanced topics such as communication between directives, dependency injection, and performance considerations. Finally, we will cover real-world usage with modern libraries. You will learn how to structure your application to work with RequireJS, bower, grunt, and testing with protractor.. At the end of this tutorial, you will know how to build robust and highly dynamic pages using AngularJS.

         Event driven programming is becoming essential to many applications and frameworks that can be utilized to make your application more flexible and “plugin” ready. Learn how to effectively use events in applications to reduce code complexity of cross-cutting concerns, how various frameworks implement events and make them available to the developer, and the benefits and drawbacks of utilizing aspect oriented development with real world examples. We will also look at many popular frameworks (Symfony2, CakePHP, Zend, etc) to see how their event architecture is implemented at a bird’s-eye view and how developers can take advantage, including a demo using Symfony2’s dispatcher to illustrate the benefits of event driven design.

         One of the first cloud platforms around, Heroku helped shaped the form of modern PaaS. Long beyond its Ruby roots, it now supports a multitude of languages, including, most recently PHP. This workshop explores the benefits, characteristics, pitfalls and approaches of the platform, and walks the audience through the preparation and creation of applications, their configuration, and all the best practices and methodologies that will allow them to get the most out of Heroku upon their first deploy, from dependency management over development/production parity to scaling up (and down again). For the brave ones, we'll sprinkle in some advanced Web server configuration, performance tuning and even a round of HHVM and Hack.

This talk will aim to provide all of the basic knowledge needed to develop a new web project using the Symfony2 framework. The talk will cover initial setup, navigating the directory structure, the routing->controller->template relationship, setting up your first pages, adding bundles, as well as a brief introduction to creating services and commands. Prior knowledge of other frameworks is not assumed, and the talk aims to be sufficiently straightforward for developers of any experience level.

         Over the past few years, the mantra in OOP PHP projects has been "Dependency Injection": get rid of those registries, service locators, and God objects. Simply put, Dependency Injection (DI) is the act of injecting objects on which a class depends via the constructor or setter methods, instead of instantiating them directly or pulling them from a known location (usually a registry). The real question, however, is: where do you create those dependency instances? This is where a concept called "Inversion of Control" (IoC) comes into play. During this session, we'll review Dependency Injection, define Inversion of Control, and look at methods of implementing IoC. Generic examples will illustrate how IoC can make it possible to automate DI, as well as provide the ability to substitute alternate implementations for dependencies when desired - thus adding flexibility to application design.

         Testing your code before deploying to Production is important - so why rely on slow, limited, manual testing? Automated tests can help protect you from introducing bugs into your applications and provide valuable feedback on application design. They're quick, they run whenever you want them to, and they don't forget about those few lines of code you wrote months ago. In this talk, you'll learn how to set up PHPUnit and configure it to run tests against your project. We'll write some tests together and go over more intermediate topics, such as mocking dependencies and making your code more "testable." Finally, we'll see which tools are available for us to help determine how much of our code is tested and to assess its overall quality. After this talk, you'll know everything you need to begin testing your PHP applications.

        title: 'Tutorial: Workshop: Improving QA on PHP Development Projects'

         Everyone talks about raising the bar on quality of code, but it's always hard to start implementing it when you have no clue where to start. With this talk I'm shooing that there are many levels developers can improve themselves by using the right tools. In this talk I'll go over each tool with examples how to use them against your codebase. A must attend talk for every developer that wants to scale up their quality. Most PHP developers deploy code that does what the customer requested but they don't have a clue about the quality of the product they deliver. Without this knowledge, maintenance can be a hell and very expensive. In this workshop I cover unit testing, code measuring, performance testing, debugging and profiling and give tips and tricks how to continue after this workshop.

         After years of promoting PHPUnit I still hear it's hard to get started with unit testing. So instead of showing nice step-by-step examples on how to use PHPUnit, we're going to take an example straight from github. So I've taken the challenge to start writing tests for PHP projects that don't have unit tests in place and explain how I decide where to begin, how I approach my test strategy and how I ensure I’m covering each possible use-case (and covering the CRAP index). The goal of this presentation is to show everyone that even legacy code, spaghetti code and complex code bases can be tested. After this talk you can immediately apply my examples on your own codebase (even if it's a clean code base) and get started with testing. To follow along a basic knowledge unit testing with PHPUnit is required.

         Traditional relational databases — ironically — are not that good at the complex relationships some modern applications need. Multiple joins and complex sub-queries can gradually take a toll on performance. Graph Databases, on the other hand, are all about relationships. In this talk we will look at using the popular Neo4j graph database with PHP to build efficient relational data for OmNomHub: not your average recipe site.

        time: 10:15 - 11:15
        desc: |
         We're sharing more, we're writing more blog posts and we're building libraries with increasingly clever names. So why does it sometimes *still* feel like rage-tossing my computer out of the window is part of solving development problems? I thought the future would let me composer install unicorns and rainbows directly into my app!? Shouldn't my experience as a developer be smoother? Having *only* great tools is just about as useful as locking me inside a Home Depot and asking me to build a house. So in this talk, we'll look at developer experience (DX) in the PHP world by going through some DX wins and some DX fails, um, "todos". I'll also share what some communities and libraries are doing specifically to make our lives easier and more productive. But ultimately, DX starts with *us*: developers who notice when things are too difficult and improve them. By the end of this talk, I hope the PHP world will have a few more DX heroes.

        title: Beyond Design Patterns
        room: 'Grand Ballroom'
        date: Saturday
        time: 10:15 - 11:15
        desc: |
         Many people teach design patterns as a fundamental step to Object Oriented Programming. They are so universally seen as important that almost every single programming conference that I have been to has had at least one talk about them. They are quite often used as interview questions to test a candidate's OOP knowledge. However, just like inheritance, they are not needed for OOP. And just like inheritance, they are a distraction rather than a foundation. Instead of focusing on patterns, I suggest focusing on learning about abstraction and communication. Why? Come and find out!

        time: 16:00 – 17:00
        desc: |
          Once upon a time, a PHP developer architected applications that both interacted with the data-store and also delivered HTML and other assets to the browser. Today, it is increasingly so the traditional PHP full stack application is no longer the piece delivering the HTML and other assets, but "merely" delivering data encapsulated as JSON. What used to be a single monolithic PHP application for many has evolved into a thin PHP API serving back-end, and a rich Single Page Application (as consumer #1 of the backend) built in JavaScript on the front-end. Along the way of this evolution, well wrangled problems and concepts like MVC, authentication, and UI/UX problems have also been redefined and reassigned to either the back-end app, front-end app, or both. In this talk, we'll attempt to bring clarity to the roles and responsibilities of the front-end application and the back-end application given a solid understanding of a traditional full stack server application.

      Many moons ago, at the tender age of 14, Cal touched his first computer. (We’re using the term “computer” loosely here, it was a TRS-80 Model 1) Since then his life has never been the same. He graduated from TRS-80s to Commodores and eventually to IBM PC’s. For the past 13 years Cal has worked with PHP and MySQL on Linux, OSX, and Windows. He has built a variety of projects ranging in size from simple web pages to multi-million dollar web applications. When not banging his head on his monitor, attempting a blood sacrifice to get a particular piece of code working, he enjoys building and managing development teams using his widely imitated but never patented management style of “management by wandering around”. These days, when not working with PHP, Cal can be found working on a variety of projects like CoderFaire. He speaks at conferences around the world on topics ranging from technical talks to motivational talks for developers. If you happen to meet him at a conference, don’t be afraid to buy him a shot of Bourbon. Cal is based in Nashville TN where he is happily married to wife 1.30, the lovely and talented Kathy. Together they have 2 wonderful kids who were both smart enough not to pursue a job in IT.

          The common mantra is “Community Works”, but does it? How does burning vacation days to speak at a conference “work”? How does staying up until the wee hours of the morning working on a project, just to turn around and go work your day job “work”? Exactly how does community pay the bills each month? Let me show you how it works.

          Let’s jog through my career as a programmer. Along the way, we will take a look at how community has not only affected my career in a positive manner; it has been a JATO strapped to my career. I’m just a programmer, not even a great one. If community can help my career, it can help anyone’s.

        desc: Developing software as part of a team introduces a host of challenges. A strong, motivated development team working together can marshal the strengths and specialities of each of its members to create something much larger than the sum of its parts. Teams that don’t work together can drain resources and make the workplace a miserable place to spend the day. The fact is, strong teams need strong leaders, and strong leadership is something that each of us can cultivate within ourselves. No matter your experience level or seniority, if you work as part of a team, you have the capacity to help lead your colleagues toward success. We’ll discuss strategies for dealing with conflict, ideas on how to become stronger communicators, and ways to help you and your teammates get the best from one another.

However, it has always been something of an odd duck, with an architecture and design very different than anything else in PHP. Enter Drupal 8: Almost a complete rewrite under the hood, Drupal 8 is a modern, PHP 5.4-boasting, REST-capable, object-oriented powerhouse. Now leveraging 3rd party components from no less than 9 different projects, Drupal 8 aims to be the premiere Content Management Platform for PHP. But how do you use all this new-fangled stuff? This session will provide a walkthrough of Drupal's key systems and APIs, intended to give developers a taste of what building with Drupal 8 will be like. Prior familiarity with Drupal 7 is helpful but will not be assumed.
