         You've made the decision. You're taking the plunge. It's responsive or bust. But what happens after the first bit of HTML and CSS is on the page? What if plan A doesn't work? HTML/CSS can be a fickle lover, so it's important to know 2 (or even 3) ways to accomplish the task at hand. This hour will be a quick overview of the history of responsive web design, as well as uncovering a plan B, C, and maybe D for your responsive layout.

         Redis is an extremely fast data structure server that can be easily added to your existing stack and act like a Swiss army knife to help solve many problems that would be extremely difficult to workaround with the traditional RDBMS. This talk will cover an introduction to Redis, how we can use it in our PHP applications and some advanced use cases beyond the most known ones, which are probably Caching and Session Management. There will also be some war stories from my time at SocialPoint, a video gaming company based in Barcelona where Redis is used extensively for projects like DragonCity that has to deal with more than 7 million daily users. I had the oportunity to give a shorter version of this talk at PHP London in August 2013. Since the time was more limited there I had to skip some topics that will be added this time if the talk gets accepted.

         Zend Framework has become a standard in the PHP world for web application development and it's successor, Zend Framework 2 is even more powerful. However, there have been many changes architecturally to the new framework that even those who are familiar with ZF1 will find hard to understand initially. In this talk we will explore the fundamental concepts of ZF2, both architecture and intent as we build ourselves a simple application.

         Everyone has used the term "but, it works on my machine ..." before and it usually resulted in disaster. Managing your local development environment has always been tricky, especially when you want it to be an exact copy of your production environment. Vagrant tries to solve this problem by offering simple tool for managing lightweight, portable and reproducible development environments. Vagrant is a tool for both individual developers and development teams. This talk will cover the basics of Vagrant and will also cover a brief introduction of configuration management tools like Puppet and Chef to provision your machines. "vagrant up" will be a command you'll learn to love. The target audience for this talk is developers looking for an easy way to manage their development environment and sharing it with team members.

         The main objectives this talk are:
         * Hassle-free setup of your development environment
         * Having a portable definition of your environment
         * Improving collaboration
         * Tearing down the walls between developers and sysadmins
         * Avoiding dependency clashes between different projects
         * Stepping away from one monolithic development environment
         * Having a replica of production to develop on
         * Boosting confidence that your code will work once it is deployed
         * Moving one step closer to continuous delivery

         Stop eyeballing your UI in a browser to test your JavaScript code - that doesn't count. While many developers have embraced testing in their server side code using TDD, fewer test their front end JavaScript code in the same way (or in any way), and even fewer of those use any kind of automation. This talk will guide attendees on how to write testable JavaScript code, how to write tests for that code, and some solutions for automating the process. Participants will come out of this talk ready to implement and automate better tests for their JavaScript code.

         Measuring and improving the performance of your PHP application is critical to giving your customers a great experience. To get a realistic view of where the time spent in PHP is actually going, you need to profile your code. XHProf is an open source, low overhead, robust profiling tool for PHP. This talk will explain how to install it, leverage its most important features, and solve the kinds of problems that XHProf can help identify. XHProf has a browser based UI, which makes it extremely easy to use and to share code profiles with coworkers. I will be demoing various traces, talking about PHP micro-optimizations, and showing you how to quickly drill down and find the slowest parts of your site. By using XHProf to identify the big wins, you can spend less time optimizing and more time building new features. You will come away from this talk with a working knowledge of XHProf, and the ability to get it up and running in your environment in minutes.

         Based on concrete examples, you will learn how to build a REST API using Symfony2 and many third-party libraries in an efficient manner. We will dive into each layer including routing, controllers, serialization, versioning, testing, the security layer and even the documentation (this list is not exhaustive). Overall, this talk describes the state of REST in the Symfony2 world. However as there is unfortunately a lot of confusion about the theory of REST, we will start off first looking at the core ideas of REST independently of Symfony2. The code examples will be based on the Symfony2 REST Edition (https://github.com/gimler/symfony-rest-edition), so its recommended for tutorial attendees to have installed it before the tutorial.

         In 1994, the Gang of Four changed the world with their book, Design Patterns. Yet nearly 20 years later, we're still struggling with design patterns. How can this be?

         The answer is that design patterns are hard. Designing reusable applications is the most challenging thing a developer can do. But there's good news: you CAN master design patterns and use them to your advantage! This workshop will show you how.

         Learn how you're already using design patterns in your own code, how to identify design patterns in the code of others, how to use eight of the most common design patterns (with live coding demonstrations!) and the ways in which design patterns can change your applications!

         Nothing is as frustrated as deploying a new release of your web application to find out functionality you had doesn't work anymore. Of course you have all your unit tests in place and you run them through your CI environment, but nothing prepared you to a failing javascript error or a link that doesn't work anymore. Welcome to User Acceptance testing or UAT. Before you start putting real people in front of your application, create macros and export them as PHPUnit test classes. Then run them in an automated way just like your unit tests and hook them into your CI. In this talk I will show you how easy it is to create Selenium macros that can be converted into PHPUnit scripts and run automatically on different virtual machines (VMs) so you can test all different browsers on a diversity of operating systems.

         Everyone talks about raising the bar on quality of code, but it's always hard to start implementing it when you have no clue where to start. With this talk I'm shooing that there are many levels developers can improve themselves by using the right tools. In this talk I'll go over each tool with examples how to use them against your codebase. A must attend talk for every developer that wants to scale up their quality.

         Most PHP developers deploy code that does what the customer requested but they don't have a clue about the quality of the product they deliver. Without this knowledge, maintenance can be a hell and very expensive.

         In this workshop I cover unit testing, code measuring, performance testing, debugging and profiling and give tips and tricks how to continue after this workshop.

        title: Scaling Applications with RabbitMQ
        room: 'Key Biscayne #1 (front)'

         Do you need to process thousands of images in the background for your web app? Do you need to share data across multiple applications, probably written in different languages and sitting at different servers? Your real time data feed is becoming slow because you are polling the database constantly for new data updates? Do you need to scale information processing during peek times? What about deploying new features with zero downtime? If any of these problems sound familiar then you probably need to use messaging in your application. In this talk I will introduce RabbitMQ, a messaging and queue server that can help us tackle those problems. We will learn how to implement messaging into our applications, use Pub/Sub, RPC and give a new meaning to the term 'decoupling'.

         I spent most of my career writing large custom in-house solutions. To me, WordPress was the software I used to run my blog, nothing more. Suddenly I found myself doing WP consulting as well as inheriting the php[architect] codebase which is completely built on top of it! I was then amazed as I dove in, at just how easy it is in WP to build any custom functionality/pages that you need via a simple API. Come learn in this session just how easy it is to build custom functionality into WP and use it as an application development framework.

         Testing our applications is something we all do. Ahem, rather, it's something we all *wish* we did. In this workshop, we'll get to work hands-on with Behat: a behavior-driven-development library that allows you to write functional tests against your application just by writing human-readable sentences/scenarios. We'll also learn about its sister-app Mink, which lets you run these tests in a real browser (via Selenium2).

         If you've heard the buzz around Behat and want to try it, or if you're not happy with the functional tests in your app, then let's get hands-on with Behat.

         Quite often we hear people talking about how to write better code, how to build systems better or how to leverage new technologies to produce better software. But how can we objectively quantify whether code is good or if it needs improving? How can we analyze an existing codebase to see what parts need improvement without spending weeks reading through the source code? The answer is provided by static analysis tools like pDepend and PHPLOC. But the results that they produce can be extremely cryptic and hard to understand. From acronyms like NPATH and CRAP to metrics like Cyclomatic Complexity and Fanout, there's a whole treasure trove of information just waiting to be descifered. In this talk, we'll explore some of the tools available for measuring software quality. We'll dive into some of the theory behind the metrics that they analyze while looking at some real world applications of those metrics. We'll also explore how to use these tools to gain valuable insight into legacy codebases. Finally, we'll look into methods to integrate those metrics into your development workflow to help improve the quality of the applications that you build.

         Imagine the day where you get an email from your CEO: "Our site has been hacked! Millions of user records have been leaked! And we're being sued!"... Unfortunately, that situation appears to be quite common place in the modern world. In the past year alone LinkedIn, Sony, Zappos, Twitter, Apple, Yahoo and LastFM (and a lot more) have compromised, leaking over 100 million user records. How has this become common place? Developers traditionally haven't focused on security (that's someone else's problem, right?)... Wrong! Security is everyone's job!

         Come and learn more about how to identify and fix security issues! In this workshop, we'll cover the most dangerous and prevalent security vulnerabilities in PHP applications today. We'll look at how those vulnerabilities work under the hood, and how to prevent them. Then, we'll spend time reviewing actual code with actual vulnerabilities. Once we've identified a potential vulnerability, you will actually execute an attack against it! By the end of the workshop, you should be able to identify insecure code and fix it!

         Who is the target audience of this workshop?
         * Any developer who has preformed code-review before
         * Any developer who wants to understand security better

         How experienced do I need to be?
         * If you understand how to read code, you have enough experience to attend this workshop!

         Tutorial requirements:
         * A laptop

         A cursory understanding of the OWASP Top 10 will be very helpful.
