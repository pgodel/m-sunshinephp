        title: Cryptography for the Average Developer
        date: Saturday
        time: 16:00 – 17:00
        desc: |
         Every developer at one point or another needs to implement some form of cryptography in one of their applications. Whether it’s hashing passwords or encrypting sensitive user data, the security requirements are daunting. Yet you don’t need to be an expert in cryptography to implement it correctly. All you need to do is understand the basics, and trust the experts.
         In this talk, we’ll take a look at some of the basic concepts of cryptography and how to implement them in PHP. Additionally, we’ll discuss the common problems that developers face and how best to solve them. Finally,  we’ll dispel some of the myths and rumors around password hashing and how (and more importantly why) to do it properly.

        desc: The same question comes every time when dealing with legacy code: shall we maintain or rewrite the whole application? Tough decision to take! Maintaining the legacy code or rewriting it from scratch may cost lots of money… Another solution would be to migrate the code from step to step by introducing new valuable pieces of software like Drupal does for their upcoming major release.

        desc: You know testing is beneficial to your project. You are familiar with merits and caveats of test-driven development.

The answer most will give is, “you don’t,” but we’re going to look at ways to write tests now that will allow you to improve and refactor your application to evolve the code to a more manageable state. The traditional “easy” route to dealing with legacy code is to rewrite but a little patience and skill applied to writing tests will yeild better results.

        title: Database Testing for Fun and Profit
        date: Friday
        time: 14:45 – 15:45
        desc: You’ve built unit tests for your project complete with mock objects for dependencies like database connections. You know that your code is running the right database queries… or do you? Updating your unit tests in tandem with your database schema really isn’t enough. To be certain that the queries executed by your code really work, you need to run them against a real database. Enter database testing. This presentation will introduce you to the Database extension for PHPUnit, the de facto unit testing framework for PHP applications. You’ll learn about everything from generating various types of test data sets to writing tests that prove your code does what you think it does to the database.


  'Larry Garfield':
    bio: |
         Larry Garfield has been building web sites since he was a sophomore in high school, which is longer ago than he’d like to admit. As a freelancer he worked mostly for Chicago-area politicians before graduating to full time consulting with Palantir.net.

         At Palantir, Larry is a Senior Architect and Consultant, developing solutions for medium to large cultural institutions.

         Larry is an active Drupal core contributor, including the principle architect and maintainer of the Drupal 7 database system. For Drupal 8 he is leading the charge to rebuild Drupal’s core code base into a powerful REST framework, leveraging the Symfony2 framework. He also served for four years as a member of the Drupal Association Board of Directors. Larry is a Zend-certified PHP 5 developer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science from DePaul University.

         Larry co-authored “Drupal 7 Module Development” from Packt Publishing, and has also been published numerous times in Drupal Watchdog. He blogs at both http://palantir.net and http://garfieldtech.com.

        title: Functional PHP
        date: Friday
        time: 10:15 - 11:15
        desc: |
            Functional programming. Some see that term and think “functions? You mean procedural programming. I’ve been doing that for years.” Others see it and think “you mean that crazy academic nonsense that no one understands? Pfft!”

            In truth, functional programming is fundamentally an approach to software development, not a particular language or syntax. With PHP 5.3, it is an approach that is now more readily available and powerful than ever before. Even if you’re not writing in Erlang or ML, there is still much to learn from the principles of functional programming to help write better code.

            This session will discuss the history of functional programming and how it compares to other programming paradigms (procedural and object-oriented). We will then delve into how to leverage the concepts and tools in PHP 5.3 to produce more robust code with an “algorithm-first” approach.

  'Nacho Martin':
    bio: Nacho Martín has been working with PHP and Symfony for several years. He co-founded the web development agency Limenius and is co-organizer of DeSymfony, the Spanish Symfony Conference.

        title: Symfony and Javascript: Combining the Best of Two Worlds
        date: Saturday
        time: 16:00 – 17:00
        desc: Javascript is an old friend of web developers that has radically changed his face in the last times. We cannot afford anymore to be only “Javascript users”. We must be prepared to combine Symfony and PHP with the new possibilities that Javascript brings to us. Javascript is a language that seems easy to learn but is in fact difficult to master. Furthermore, this technology is very different from PHP with Symfony, from its concurrency model to more human aspects like its ecosystem. In this talk we will show what challenges must face the Symfony developer when integrating this technology. We will also explore how to combine two very different stacks to solve real problems. We will see how does a traditional Symfony project change when we move logic to the client side using frameworks such as Backbone.js, and also how to lean on server-side Javascript with node.js for certain services such as real time notifications.


  'Paul M. Jones':
    bio: Paul is an internationally recognized PHP expert who has worked as everything from junior developer to VP of Engineering in all kinds of organizations (corporate, military, non-profit, educational, medical, and others).  Paul’s latest open-source project is the Aura project for PHP. Among his other accomplishments, Paul is the lead developer of the Solar Framework, and the creator of the Savant template system. He has authored a series of autho ritative benchmarks on dynamic framework performance, and was a founding contributor to the Zend Framework (the DB, DB_Table, and View components). In a previous career, Paul was an intelligence operations specialist for the US Air Force, and enjoys putting .308 holes in targets at 400 yards.

        title:  It Was Like That When I Got Here: Steps Toward Modernizing a Legacy Codebase
        date: Saturday
        time: 14:45 – 15:45
        desc: The codebase at work is absolutely terrible. It’s a mess of spaghetti that has been around for years and is and completely untestable. Any time you fix a bug right here, a new bug appears over there. In this talk, Paul explains why the code is so bad, and gives practical steps on how you can start digging your way out of the legacy hole while keeping the system running the whole time.


  'Rasmus Lerdorf':
    bio: Rasmus Lerdorf is known for having gotten the PHP project off the ground in 1995 and has contributed to a number of other open source projects over the years.

  'Rowan Merewood':
    bio: Rowan is a software engineer and technical team lead at the Inviqa group. He’s worked commercially with PHP for well over 6 years, dabbling before that in Python, Java, and BASIC if you go back far enough. His work has encompassed everything from tiny in-page scripts through to multi-million pound billing engines using a wide variety of open source technologies. Rowan is based in Sheffield, UK and makes semi-regular treks over to the PHPNW user group meetings and accidentally organises the Sheffield PHP user group. Talk to him about creative cocktails and appalling horror films.

        title: From the Ground Up – Coding, Deploying, and Scaling with AWS
        date: Friday
        time: 14:45 – 15:45
        desc: Ten years ago the Amazon Web Services platform was launched and in that time it has dominated and shaped the way cloud computing is viewed. Even after a decade there are still a lot of buzzwords flying around and putting your app in the cloud is often sold as a simple, cure-all solution. So what’s really involved? This talk will give you a hands-on walkthrough of building a PHP application stack in AWS. We’ll start by deploying a simple Silex application to the Elastic Beanstalk and then add in a selection of other AWS services. This is not a theoretical, text-book session – this is real-life configuration with the cool concepts and tricky hacks that involves.
